# GogTest

## The demo is available at [sparksjj.github.io/gog-test](https://sparksjj.github.io/gog-test/)

## Just wrapped up the test task â€” itâ€™s not perfect, but I tried to put a bit of focus on performance and accessibility. For example, you can navigate the interface using just your keyboard ðŸ™‚ Also added a small animation for the secret button â€” hope you like it! Looking forward to hearing from you. Enjoy!
